== Problem
There are many houses on the market. Some of them are hard to find. We aim to create a tool to help search the housing market so you can find your dream home.
== Motivation
Many home buyers struggle to find their perfect home, whether thatâ€™s because of the price, location, or design. As future home buyers we wanted to make a tool that makes this process easy for everyone.
== Features
We will know that this problem is solved once the user is able to give our program their desired request and receive a list of homes with a link to the home.
